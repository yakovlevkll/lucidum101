# Три угла

Треугольники

Consist of:

* sides
* angles
* verticies (points)

## Types

* Scalene (everything is different):
    * acute - all angles are less then 90deg
    * right-angled - 1 angle equals to 90 deg
    * obtuse - 1 angle is more than 90deg
* Isosceles -2 sides and 2 angles are the same
    * Equilateral - all sides are equal, all angles are equal

_Theorem_: _Sum of internal angles equals to 180deg_ Can be proved by parallel lines
_Pythogerean theorem_: _If the triangle has a right angle then a^2 + b^2 = c^2. a and b are catets, c is hypotenuse_

## Median, bisector, height
Those lines can be drawn from any vertex

Bisector - line that divides angle in two equal parts
Height - line that touches opposite side with an 90deg angle
Median - line that connects vertex with midpoint of opposite side

All medians intersect in one point - center of masses
All bisectors interset in one point - center of inner circle

_Theorem_: _Any median divides triangle in two trinagles with same areas_

## Area

Половина произведения основания на высоту

$$A = \dfrac{b * h}{2}$$

$$p = \dfrac{a + b + c}{2}$$

$$A = \sqrt{p(p - a)(p - b)(p - c)}$$

## Middle line

## Similarity

If

* 2 angles and 1 side
* 2 sides and 1 angle
* all ???

are equal in two triangles, those triangles are equal (similar)

## Congruence
If all angles in one trangle equal to all angles in second triangle, those triangles are congruent
