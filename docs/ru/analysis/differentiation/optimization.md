1.  A company sells a product at a price of $p$ euros. The number of units sold depends on the price according to the function
    $$V(p) = \dfrac{30p + 10}{p}$$
    a. Prove that, when prices increase, sales decline.
    b. Is it possible for the company to sell 20 units of the product? If the price increases indefinitely, what will happen to the sales?

2.  In an orchard there are planted 50 apple trees. Each tree produces 800 apples. For each additional tree we plant, the production of each tree is reduced by 10 apples. How many trees do we need to plant to obtain the highest possible production? What is this production?

3.  If a toy is sold at €130, it is purchased by 1000 people. For each euro that increases this price, the number of buyers decreases by 50, respectively.  
    a) Make a graph of the number of toys that are sold i work the sales price and give the formula that expresses it.  
    b) The cost price of a toy is € 80. Calculate the price $p$, which gives a maximum total benefit.  
    c) Find the number of toys that are sold if the price is $p$ and calculate the maximum benefit.

4.  The tangent line to parabola $y = 3 - x^2$ at a point $M$ located within the first quadrant $(x > 0, y > 0)$, cuts the axis $OX$ at the point $A$ and axis $OY$ in point $B$.  
    a) Make a graph of the elements of the problem.  
    b) Find the coordinates of the point $M$ that make the triangle $OAB$ have the minimum area.

5.  Given the function $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ and the point $A(2, 0)$ located on the axis of the abscissaes.  
    a) Find the function that expresses the distance from point $A$ to any point of the function graph.  
    b) Find the coordinates of the point of $f(x)$ closest to $A$.

6.  You want to build a swimming pool that has a rectangle and two adjacent semicircles on the base as shown in the figure below.  
    ![Pool](pool.svg)  
    Knowing that the perimeter of the pool should be 30 m, calculate its dimensions so that the area is maximum.

7.  Consider the function  
    $f(x) = \dfrac {x^3} {30} - 15x^2 + 2500$
    a) Calculate the equation of the tangent line at the abscissa point $x = 0$.  
    b) At what point in the curve is the slope of the tangent line minimal? What is the value of the minimum slope?

8.  A tree has a volume of 30 m<sup>3</sup> and, for the quality of its wood, it sells at €50 per cubic meter. Every year the tree increases the volume in 3 m<sup>3</sup>. At the same time, the quality of the tree's wood decreases, and also the price, which every year is a cheaper euro per cubic meter. In how many years will we achieve the maximum income for the sale of tree wood? What are these revenues?
