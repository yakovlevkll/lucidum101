1. Consider a function

   a. Indicate the domain and study its growth.
   b. Calculate the equations of the tangent lines in the graph of f that are parallel to the line $y + 3x = 2$.

   a. Calculate how much the slope of the tangent line is worth in its graph for the abscissa point $x = 0$.  
   b. Find if there are other points in which the slope of the tangent is equal to that obtained.

3. Determine the values of the parameters $a$, $b$ and $c$ that make the equation curves $f(x) = x^3 + ax + b$ and $g(x) = x^3 + cx^2 - 2$ have the same tangent line at the point $(1, 1)$.

4. Let function $f(x) = x^3 - x^2$.
   a. Find the equation of the tangent line to the graph and that is parallel to the equation line $x + 3y = 0$.
   b. Calculate, if any, the points of the graph in which the function has a relative maximum or minimum or a turning point.

5. We know that the function
   $$f(x) = ax^3 + 3x^2 - bx - \dfrac{1}{3}$$
   passes through point $(1, 0)$, and that the tangent line to the graph of the function at this point is parallel to the straight line $12x - 2y = 3$.  
    a) Determine the values of the parameters $a$ and $b$.  
    b) For $a = 1$ and $b = 9$, determine, if any, the abscissons of the possible ends (maxims or minims) of the function, and classify them.

6. Determine the values of the parameters $a$, $b$ and $c$ that ??? that the equation curves $f(x) = x^3 + ax + b$ and $g(x) = x^3 + cx^2 - 2$ have the same tangent line at the point $(1, 1)$.

7. We know that a function $f(x)$ has derivative $f'(x) = (x + 1) * e^x$ and $f(0) = 2$.
   a. Find the equation of the tangent line at $y = f(x)$ at the point of the abscissa curve $x = 0$.
   b. Calculate the expression of $f(x)$.

8. Consider the function
