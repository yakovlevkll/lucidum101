1. Calculate the relative maximums, relative minimums and turning points of the function
   $$f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x - 4$$

2. Consider a function
   $$f(x) = \dfrac{1}{x^2-k}$$
   in which $k$ is a real parameter different from 0. For the different values of the parameter $k$:
   a. Calculate the domain and functions of the function.
   b. Calculate the points with a maximum or a relative minimum.

3. The function derived from a function $f$ is
   $$f(x) = (x - 5) * e^{-2x}$$
   a. If you have it, determine and classify the ends of the function $f$.
   b. We know that the graph of $f$ passes through $P(0, 2)$. Calculate the equation of the tangent line to $f$ passing through this point.

4. Consider the real variable real function
   $$f(x) = \dfrac{2x^3}{x^2 - 1}$$
   a. Find the domain.  
   b. Calculate the equation of your asymptotes, if you have it.  
   c. Study the growth and degrowth intervals, as well as the absences of their relative extremes, if any, and classify them

5. Let $f$ be a grade 3 polynomial, with a maximum of $(0, 0)$ and a minimum of $(2, -4)$.  
   a) Make an approximate graph of $f$.  
   b) Determine the formula of the function.

6. Consider the function  
   $$f(x) = x^3 - ax^2 + 9x + b$$
   a. Determine $a$ and $b$, knowing that the graph of $f$ goes through point $(2, 2)$ and has an endpoint at $x = 1$.
   b. For $a = 6$ and $b = 0$, determine the possible maximum and minimum of $f$ and classify them.

7. Below is a graph of a function $f$ that has a relative minimum at the point of abscissa $x = -1$ and a relative maximum at the point of abscissa $x = 1$.

   a) Knowing that $f'(0) = 1$, determine the equation of the tangent line at $f$ that goes through the origin of the coordinates.  
   b) Make a sketch of the function $f'$ with the data you have.
