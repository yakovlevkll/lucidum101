# Экспоненциальный рост

::: task

1. As of a certain date, in this population health measures are applied that allow the number of infected people to decrease according to the function
   $$g(x) = 1,000 * (0.95)^x$$
   If we consider the epidemic to be controlled when the number of people affected is equal to or less than 10 people, how many days will they have to pass after applying sanitary measures to be able to declare the epidemic to be controlled?

2. The function derived from a function $f$ is
   $$f'(x) = e^{-2x}(x - x^2)$$
   a. Study the growth and decreased function $f$.
   b. If the function $f$ has relative extremes, indicate the abscisses and classify them.

3. Let $f(x) = x^2 * e^{-ax}$ where $a \ne 0$.
   a. Calculate the value of a because this function has a relative endpoint at the abscissa point $x = 2$.
   b. When $a = 2$, classify its relative ends.
