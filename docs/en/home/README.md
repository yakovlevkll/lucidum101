## Description

This non-commercial project aims to create and distribute a free textbook for secondary and higher education, aimed at ahead of modern world educational standards.

## Content

The narration is based on the following topics:

- Logic and patterns
- Algorithms
- Applied mathematics
- Physics, chemistry, biology
- Computer science
- Ecology
- Social sciencies
- Arts

Despite the generally accepted approach to learning through the study of individual disciplines, this project aims to link the above topics in the context of the development of both the individual and society as a whole.

## Manifesto

The principles of this project are

1. Openness. Real education can exist only in a generally accessible format.
2. Versatility. The development of man and society as a whole is impossible without constant adaptation to changing external conditions.
3. Consistency. Fragile knowledge will always be weaker relative to balanced picture of the world and its phenomena.
4. Balance. Education should form both abstract thinking and practical skills.

The modern world suffers from an oversupply of information. It is time to convert quantity to quality.
