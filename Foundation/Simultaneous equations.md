# Simultaneous equations
We have 3 basic methods to solve simultaneous equations. Each of those has their own pluses and minuses.

## Addition/subtraction

Supose we have this system
$$
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{c}
2x+y=10 \\
x+2y=12
\end{array}
\right.
 $$

We can add or subtract one equation following these steps:
1. Make equal coefficients before one of the variables

$$
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{c}
2x+y=10 \\
x+2y=12 \quad | \cdot 2
\end{array}
\right.
 $$
 
 $$
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{c}
2x+y=10 \\
2x+4y=24
\end{array}
\right.
 $$
3. Add 2 equations, if signs before variables with same coefficients are differ ($+ -$ or $-+$). Subtract 2 equations if signs before variables with same coefficients are the same ($++$ or $--$)
 $$
2x + 4y - (2x + y) = 10  - 24
 $$
