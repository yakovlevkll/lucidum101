# Simultaneous equations
We have 3 basic methods to solve simultaneous equations. Each of those has their own pluses and minuses.

## Addition/subtraction

Supose we have this system
$$
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{c}
2x+y=10 \\
x+2y=11
\end{array}
\right.
 $$

We can add or subtract one equation following these steps:
1. Make equal coefficients before one of the variables

$$
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{l}
2x+y=10 \\
x+2y=11 \quad| \cdot 2
\end{array}
\right.
$$
 
$$
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{c}
2x+y=10 \\
2x+4y=22
\end{array}
\right.
$$

2. Add 2 equations, if signs before variables with same coefficients are differ ($+ -$ or $-+$). Subtract 2 equations if signs before variables with same coefficients are the same ($++$ or $--$)

$2x + 4y - (2x + y) = 22 - 10$
$2x + 4y - 2x - y = 12$
$3y = 12$
$y = 4$

Then we need to put it in on of the initial equations
$2x + y = 10$
$2x + 4 = 10$
$2x = 6$
$x = 3$

So we've found a solution
$$
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{c}
x = 3 \\
y = 4
\end{array}
\right.
 $$
 
## Replacement

$$
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{c}
a - 20 = (15 + b) \cdot 6 \\
a = (15 - b) \cdot 10
\end{array}
\right.
 $$

In cases like this we can replace variable in one equation with another one

$(15 - b) \cdot 10 - 20 = (15 + b) \cdot 6$
