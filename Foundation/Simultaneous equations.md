# Simultaneous equations
We have 3 basic methods to solve simultaneous equations. Each of those has their own pluses and minuses.

## Addition/subtraction

Supose we have this system
$$
\left\{ 
\begin{array}{c}
2x+y=10 \\
x+2y=12
\end{array}
\right.
 $$
 
We can add or subtract one equation following these steps:
1. Make equal coecients before one of the variables
2. Add 2 equations, if signs before variables with same coefficients are differ (+ - or -+) Subtract 2 equations if signs before variables with same coecients are the same (+ + or - -)
