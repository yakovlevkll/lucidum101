## Derivatives

1. As of a certain date, in this population health measures are applied that allow the number of infected people to decrease according to the function 
$$g(x) = 1,000 \cdot (0.95)^x$$
If we consider the epidemic to be controlled when the number of people affected is equal to or less than 10 people, how many days will they have to pass after applying sanitary measures to be able to declare the epidemic to be controlled?

2. The function derived from a function $f$ is
$$f'(x) = e^{-2x}(x - x^2)$$
a. Study the growth and decreased function $f$.
b. If the function $f$ has relative extremes, indicate the abscisses and classify them.

3. The function derived from a function $f$ is
$$f(x) = (x - 5) \cdot e^{-2x}$$
a. If you have it, determine and classify the ends of the function $f$.
b. We know that the graph of $f$ passes through $P(0.2)$. Calculate the equation of the tangent line to $f$ passing through this point.

4. Calculate the relative maximums, relative minimums and turning points of the function
$$f(x) = 2x^3 - 9x^2 + 12x - 4$$
